    <!--This is Day 1, learning HTML.
    This Exact day is based on partly covering the
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA HTML Full Course
    for Beginners | Complete All-in-One Tutorial | 4 Hours | 2023
    video-->

    <h1>As usually, we start with Hello World!</h1><br>
    <p id="p1">This is a paragraph, with opening and closing tags 'p'<br>
       Above those paragraph/s you can see the Header with tags 'h1' </p>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>This is Header 2</h2><br>
    <p id="p2">In this paragraph I would like to mention that
        during today's learning, I opted for creating
        a style section within the HTML file itself,
        instead of creating a separate CSS file.
    </p><br>
    <p>I used id's for two first paragraphs so I could separetely apply different styles to them.</p>
</body>
<style>
   body {
        background-color: lightblue;
        text-align: center;
    }
    html {
        font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    }
    h1 {
        color: navy;
    }
    h2 {
        color: darkred;
    }
    p {
        font-size: 20px;
    }
    #p1 {
        color: green;
    }
    #p2 {
        color: purple;
        font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
    }
</style>
